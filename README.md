# Frontend

A simple frontend for the microservices system.  
Built to consume APIs exposed via the backend API Gateway.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- UI Components: shadcn/ui
- API Communication: REST

## Responsibilities
- User authentication and token handling
- Displaying product and order data
- Basic user interactions with backend services
- Minimal UI to support backend architecture testing

## Architecture Notes
- All requests go through the API Gateway
- JWT is stored client-side and sent with requests
- Frontend does not directly communicate with individual services

## Getting Started
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
